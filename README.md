dndtable
========

This softwares purpose is to handle a scanned map image on a flat screen viewer face upwards. The table formed by this is used for tabletop miniature game Dungeons & Dragons. Its method is usable in other grid/hex etc. tabletop games. 

Key element of the software is the map. It is aquired by scanning it from hte book.

The software is driven in web browser. Initial intention was to use software locally with file-protocol, but it works over web in all browsers. Internet Explorer does not support localStorage in file-protocol.

Usage

copy example folder
overwrite map.png with scanned map image
open index.html in browser
use browser zoom to adjust grid to 25mm size on screen
drag and resize the cover divs (20pcs) on areas wished to hide
use mouse right click commands to change shape, rotation, color, opacity or lock, free hide them.
use mouse right click commands to lock map show/hide al covers
Reveal the map as party advances
Game on!

Contribution is welcome.

Future development is to implement HTML5 canvas which enables drawing the cover boundaries. More fluid rotation. to mention few.
